    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "# Answers\n",
    "* ### 1) The questions is whether race simply 'has' an effect. It doesn't mention whether it is looking for a negative or positive effect. Because of this the appropriate test for this is a two tailed test. \n",
    "    * #### The central limit theorem does apply because as we approach taking an infinite amount of means of random samples selected from the sample of resumes, the distribution looks more and more normal.\n",
    "* ### 2A) Null Hypothesis = Race has no effect on the probability of getting a call back or not.\n",
    "* ### 2B) Alt. Hypothesis = Race does have an effect on the probability of getting a call back or not.\n",
    "* ### 3A) Confidence Interval = We can be confident that 95% of time we select a random sample fom the true population of means, given our null hypothesis is true, it will be between .074, and .118\n",
    "* ### 3B) Margin of Error = Our margin of error is about 16.6 percent\n",
    "* ### 3C) P-Value = The p-value for our null hypothesis is .018%\n",
    "* ### 4) Story = If our hypothesis is correct that race, in this case that how black or white sounding your name is on your resume is, has no effect on how likely you will get a call back or not, the probability that getting the average of calls returned for black sounding resumes is less than 1 percent. Given this, we can strongly reject our null  hypothesis, and conclude that race does in fact have an effect on whether or not you will get a call back or not.\n",
    "* ### 5) There would be no way of knowing this unless we checked the correlation between all of the features of the resume, and the target feature of callback success."
